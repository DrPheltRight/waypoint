# Waypoint

A CoffeeScript URI router for use anywhere.

## In the browser

First you'll want to clone the git repository like so:

	git clone git://github.com/DrPheltRight/waypoint.git
	cd waypoint

You'll find the latest development version of Waypoint for the
browser in the `dist` directory. You can either use this or
build your own like so:

	cake build:browser

If you wanted to build the master version you can simply
checkout that branch.
